# Tweet Analyzer

Tweet Analyzer is a full-stack project that aims to analyze and display a large collection of tweets. It involves a backend component that handles the insertion of 1.6 million tweets, their IDs, usernames, and polarity into an ArrayList, and a GUI front end created using Eclipse WindowBuilder to present the data in an interactive and creative way.

## Features

- Backend Data Handling: The project utilizes a robust backend system to efficiently insert and manage 1.6 million tweets along with their associated information. The backend is responsible for handling data storage and retrieval, allowing for fast and reliable access to the tweet dataset.

- Tweet Data Structure: The tweet data is stored in an ArrayList, providing an efficient and flexible structure for storing and manipulating large amounts of tweet information. The data structure allows for easy access, modification, and retrieval of tweet data based on various criteria.

- GUI Front End: The project incorporates a graphical user interface (GUI) front end using Eclipse WindowBuilder. The GUI provides an intuitive and visually appealing interface to interact with the tweet dataset. It offers features such as filtering, sorting, and searching functionality, enabling users to explore the tweet data in a dynamic and creative way.

Once the project is set up and running, you can use the Tweet Analyzer GUI to explore and interact with the tweet dataset. Some possible use cases include:

- Filtering: Apply filters based on tweet polarity, username, or other relevant criteria to narrow down the displayed tweets.

- Sorting: Sort the tweets based on factors like polarity, timestamp, or user engagement to gain insights and identify patterns.

- Search: Utilize the search functionality to find specific tweets or keywords within the dataset quickly.

- Visualizations: Take advantage of the creative display options in the GUI to visualize the tweet data in charts, graphs, or other visual representations.
